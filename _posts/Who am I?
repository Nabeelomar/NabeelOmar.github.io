<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<h3>A short introudction</h3>
Hi, I’m Nabeel Omar, a driven and passionate individual with a strong interest in law, finance, and advocacy. I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Business Administration with a focus on Finance and a minor in Law, Science, and Technology at Georgia Tech. This fall, I’ll be starting my J.D. at Emory University School of Law, where I plan to further develop my ability to advocate for those in need.

My passion for advocacy and civic engagement was sparked early. During high school, I participated in a medical mission in Lamu, Kenya, where I witnessed firsthand how political instability and geographic isolation deprived communities of basic healthcare. Seeing the dedication of Safari Doctors, a group that risked their safety to provide medical aid, inspired me to pursue a path where I could address social injustices.

This sense of responsibility carried into my work as a Gwinnett County Youth Commissioner, where I engaged with local government officials to advocate for public transportation improvements that would benefit underserved youth. Later, my experiences working with the Georgia Muslim Voter Project reinforced my desire to create meaningful change. Through voter registration drives and civic education initiatives, I connected with individuals from diverse backgrounds, helping them understand the power of their voice in shaping policy.

<h3>Legal & Business Interests</h3>
At Georgia Tech, I realized that combining business with law could provide me with the tools to drive systemic change. My coursework in Law, Science, and Technology introduced me to foundational legal principles, while my internship at York Gaskill, LLC gave me real-world exposure to legal proceedings. Watching attorneys handle cases involving wrongful foreclosures and probate matters reinforced my interest in advocating for justice.

Additionally, my experience in finance and business strategy has strengthened my analytical skills. Whether conducting property valuations at Ace Homes, LLC or leading Bizz Speak at Georgia Tech to help students develop public speaking skills, I’ve sought to use my knowledge to empower others.

<h3>What Drives Me?</h3>
More than anything, I’m passionate about representing, advocating for, and helping communities in need. My experiences across different countries—whether in Kenya, India, Pakistan, Morocco, or Turkey—have opened my eyes to the inequalities that exist globally. At the same time, I’ve learned that change begins at home, and I’m committed to using my skills to make a difference locally and beyond.

As I prepare to embark on my legal education at Emory, I’m eager to continue growing, learning, and advocating for justice. My goal is to blend my knowledge of business and law to create tangible, lasting impact—whether through legal representation, policy work, or community engagement.
